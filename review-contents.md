Now, Whitney, who lately has been having a shit life, comes home for the holidays to her family&#8217;s giant cabin in the North Carolina mountains. Her large family is also there too&#8230;. including Eli who now was invited by brother, Brendan. (He didn&#8217;t know their history.) All of the family is portrayed with great detail here&#8211;I really enjoyed toddler Peyton&#8211;and there&#8217;s a lot going on in all the varied relationships.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s clear from the beginning that Eli has come to make amends and win back the woman he loved and then dumped his last year of college. This didn&#8217;t really do much for me. He&#8217;s forty and the two dated for eight months back in the day. He&#8217;s also rich, handsome, funny, great in bed, and wonderful with kids&#8211;I had a hard time believing he&#8217;d never have found another love. And it seems like the only reason Whitney, despite coming from the world&#8217;s most perfect family (her two siblings are married with kids), never settled down was because she never got over Eli. That&#8217;s a lot of wasted time: they should have moved on years ago!&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And while I loved Whitney&#8217;s family&#8211;both of her siblings are facing some marital challenges&#8211;they did distract from the love story. But really, I&#8217;m not sure that&#8217;s a bad thing. Whitney and Eli spend what seems like eons remembering their pasts, regretting the pasts, thinking about the impact the past has had on them&#8211;a hundred pages in, I was wildly bored with their interior monologues. This is a story that needed half as many pages as it has.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In the last chapters, Eli comes clean about the reason he behaved caddishly all those years ago. And, whoa, was it a downer. His past has so much trauma that I began to doubt he had his shit together now.

                "text": "The Plight Before Christmas needs an editor, has leads in their late thirties who behave at least ten years younger, and manufactures so much angst in its final few chapters that I felt cheated the book didn&#8217;t come with its own tissues.&nbsp; Our leads, Whitney and Eli, were in love seventeen years ago and&#8211;shocker&#8211;it ended badly. Now, Whitney, who lately has been having a shit life, comes home for the holidays to her family&#8217;s giant cabin in the North Carolina mountains. Her large family is also there too&#8230;. including Eli who now was invited by brother, Brendan. (He didn&#8217;t know their history.) All of the family is portrayed with great detail here&#8211;I really enjoyed toddler Peyton&#8211;and there&#8217;s a lot going on in all the varied relationships.&nbsp; It&#8217;s clear from the beginning that Eli has come to make amends and win back the woman he loved and then dumped his last year of college. This didn&#8217;t really do much for me. He&#8217;s forty and the two dated for eight months back in the day. He&#8217;s also rich, handsome, funny, great in bed, and wonderful with kids&#8211;I had a hard time believing he&#8217;d never have found another love. And it seems like the only reason Whitney, despite coming from the world&#8217;s most perfect family (her two siblings are married with kids), never settled down was because she never got over Eli. That&#8217;s a lot of wasted time: they should have moved on years ago!&nbsp; And while I loved Whitney&#8217;s family&#8211;both of her siblings are facing some marital challenges&#8211;they did distract from the love story. But really, I&#8217;m not sure that&#8217;s a bad thing. Whitney and Eli spend what seems like eons remembering their pasts, regretting the pasts, thinking about the impact the past has had on them&#8211;a hundred pages in, I was wildly bored with their interior monologues. This is a story that needed half as many pages as it has.&nbsp; In the last chapters, Eli comes clean about the reason he behaved caddishly all those years ago. And, whoa, was it a downer. His past has so much trauma that I began to doubt he had his shit together now. I&#8217;m not the world&#8217;s biggest fan of angst in contemporary romance and here, after pages of sexy times, family pranks, and amusing kids, Eli&#8217;s true confession sucked all the joy out of the novel&#8217;s HEA.&nbsp; I guess if you&#8217;re looking for a holiday story with a sweet but foul mouthed family (they really were my favorite part of the book), and a lead couple whose sex life, both imagined and real, is given lots of page time&#8211;much of it in memory&#8211;and you are more patient than I, this one might work for you.

Its first chapter, <em data-start=\"269\" data-end=\"305\">The First Death of Una Everlasting</em>, reads like a eulogy written for a nation&#8217;s best. We’re told that Una, knight of the realm, died for her queen, and that sacrifice birthed a great nation. But the story we’re given isn’t the one that was. It’s one version, one fate. But in Harrow&#8217;s brilliant book, fate can be rewritten.</p>\n<p data-start=\"655\" data-end=\"1195\">Owen works as a historian in the republic of Dominion. Una’s legend is its founding myth, and Owen’s job is to preserve it.

                "text": "The Everlasting begins where it ends: beneath a yew tree. Its first chapter, The First Death of Una Everlasting, reads like a eulogy written for a nation&#8217;s best. We’re told that Una, knight of the realm, died for her queen, and that sacrifice birthed a great nation. But the story we’re given isn’t the one that was. It’s one version, one fate. But in Harrow&#8217;s brilliant book, fate can be rewritten. Owen works as a historian in the republic of Dominion. Una’s legend is its founding myth, and Owen’s job is to preserve it. When he receives an anonymous envelope containing what appears to be the original manuscript of Una’s story, he doesn’t just read it—he enters it.

The story starts strong and keeps its momentum. I enjoyed it immensely.</p>\n<p>After the events of <strong>Book of Night</strong>, Charlie is in as much trouble as ever. She’s working for the Cabals, magicians who bend shadows and people to their will. Her sister Posey is hiding something big and probably lethal. At The Rapture, the bar where she works, the upstairs is tense and the downstairs is worse. And Red—who was once Vince—is back. He looks the same, but his memory is gone. He doesn’t remember Charlie or trust her, which is rough because Charlie remembers everything—and misses it. Even though Red doesn&#8217;t want to be near her, he can&#8217;t stay away. Staying alive is easier with Red at her side. The two must work together—not only to survive but to stop the people who’ve taken control of the shadow world. I loved them both in this novel, both as individuals and as a pair.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Everything in this book works better. The magic finally has rules that make sense. The villains are smart and dangerous because they know what they want. Posey becomes a character in her own right, not just a source of mystery. The shadow world stops being atmosphere and becomes a place you can actually believe in. And, through it all, Charlie and Red carry the story with clarity, connection, and a lovely amount of snark.</p>\n<p>One choice near the end pulled me out. Black reaches for fury where the story called for something quieter. I didn’t believe it, and, in general, I&#8217;m not a fan of anything treading too close to nihilism. But, really, this is a small complaint about a novel I loved.</p>\n<p><strong>Thief of Night</strong> is a smart, high-stakes novel that rewards the patience the first book demands. <strong>Book of Night</strong> is a heavy lift. But <strong>Thief of Night</strong> makes it worth it.</p>\n",

Thief of Night is everything Book of Night failed to be: smart, funny, and firmly rooted in a world that finally feels real. The story starts strong and keeps its momentum. I enjoyed it immensely. After the events of Book of Night, Charlie is in as much trouble as ever. She’s working for the Cabals, magicians who bend shadows and people to their will. Her sister Posey is hiding something big and probably lethal. At The Rapture, the bar where she works, the upstairs is tense and the downstairs is worse. And Red—who was once Vince—is back. He looks the same, but his memory is gone. He doesn’t remember Charlie or trust her, which is rough because Charlie remembers everything—and misses it. Even though Red doesn&#8217;t want to be near her, he can&#8217;t stay away. Staying alive is easier with Red at her side. The two must work together—not only to survive but to stop the people who’ve taken control of the shadow world. I loved them both in this novel, both as individuals and as a pair.&nbsp; Everything in this book works better. The magic finally has rules that make sense. The villains are smart and dangerous because they know what they want. Posey becomes a character in her own right, not just a source of mystery. The shadow world stops being atmosphere and becomes a place you can actually believe in. And, through it all, Charlie and Red carry the story with clarity, connection, and a lovely amount of snark. One choice near the end pulled me out. Black reaches for fury where the story called for something quieter. I didn’t believe it, and, in general, I&#8217;m not a fan of anything treading too close to nihilism. But, really, this is a small complaint about a novel I loved. Thief of Night is a smart, high-stakes novel that rewards the patience the first book demands. Book of Night is a heavy lift. But Thief of Night makes it worth it."

                "html": "<p>Karin Slaughter’s <strong>We Are All Guilty Here</strong> opens with a disappearance. Two teenage girls vanish during a Fourth of July celebration in North Falls, Georgia—a town that prides itself on familiarity and tradition. Officer Emmy Clifton is devastated. One of the girls is the stepdaughter of her closest friend, and Emmy is determined to find them before it’s too late.</p>\n<p>Emmy is early in her career, working alongside her beloved father, the town’s sheriff. She is also a mother, a sister, a wife in a marriage that is quietly unraveling, and a member of the Clifton family—a long-established clan whose roots in North Falls run deep. Her marriage may be faltering, but her life is full of responsibility and connection. She is shaped by loyalty, instinct, and a steady commitment to doing what’s right. She is not hardened or brittle. She is present, capable, and fully embedded in the world around her. I liked her tremendously.</p>\n<p>Slaughter has long excelled at writing strong willed women who, no matter what is thrown their way, survive, even thrive. Emmy is one of her best. In her work life, she&#8217;s committed to using the power of the law to help others. In her personal life, she&#8217;s a gift to those she loves. Slaughter makes her relatable and real&#8211;in fact, all of the characters are vividly limned.</p>\n<p>Her parents, George and Myrna, age over the course of the novel in ways that will be immediately recognizable to anyone watching loved ones grow older. Her son Cole, in his twenties, is a standout. He&#8217;s such a 20 something and yet, like his mom, is observant, decent, and emotionally steady in a way that matters. Emmy’s friendship with Hannah, her closest confidante, and her relationship with her sister-in-law Celia are equally vivid. These women comfort, challenge, and support each other with a mix of candor and care that feels earned. The Cliftons, as a family, struggle to talk openly about their emotions. They are strong, often quiet, unfailingly loyal, and surprisingly funny. They love without flourish. That limitation becomes a strength. Emmy is not idealized, but she is the kind of person you want nearby when things fall apart.</p>\n<p>The Clifton family, in fact, is every bit as compelling as the villains and the havoc they create.

                "text": "Karin Slaughter’s We Are All Guilty Here opens with a disappearance. Two teenage girls vanish during a Fourth of July celebration in North Falls, Georgia—a town that prides itself on familiarity and tradition. Officer Emmy Clifton is devastated. One of the girls is the stepdaughter of her closest friend, and Emmy is determined to find them before it’s too late. Emmy is early in her career, working alongside her beloved father, the town’s sheriff. She is also a mother, a sister, a wife in a marriage that is quietly unraveling, and a member of the Clifton family—a long-established clan whose roots in North Falls run deep. Her marriage may be faltering, but her life is full of responsibility and connection. She is shaped by loyalty, instinct, and a steady commitment to doing what’s right. She is not hardened or brittle. She is present, capable, and fully embedded in the world around her. I liked her tremendously. Slaughter has long excelled at writing strong willed women who, no matter what is thrown their way, survive, even thrive. Emmy is one of her best. In her work life, she&#8217;s committed to using the power of the law to help others. In her personal life, she&#8217;s a gift to those she loves. Slaughter makes her relatable and real&#8211;in fact, all of the characters are vividly limned. Her parents, George and Myrna, age over the course of the novel in ways that will be immediately recognizable to anyone watching loved ones grow older. Her son Cole, in his twenties, is a standout. He&#8217;s such a 20 something and yet, like his mom, is observant, decent, and emotionally steady in a way that matters. Emmy’s friendship with Hannah, her closest confidante, and her relationship with her sister-in-law Celia are equally vivid. These women comfort, challenge, and support each other with a mix of candor and care that feels earned. The Cliftons, as a family, struggle to talk openly about their emotions. They are strong, often quiet, unfailingly loyal, and surprisingly funny. They love without flourish. That limitation becomes a strength. Emmy is not idealized, but she is the kind of person you want nearby when things fall apart. The Clifton family, in fact, is every bit as compelling as the villains and the havoc they create. Slaughter gives them the kind of layered attention most thrillers reserve for the perpetrators. Their affection is messy and enduring. Their friction feels lived-in. They linger because they are drawn with clarity and warmth. The novel unfolds in three parts.
