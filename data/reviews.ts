            "text": "(originally published on December 25, 2019) Despite being a family of non-believers, every year we pull out our holiday paraphernalia. We dress the tree, hanging with care the delicate glass ornaments gifted to us over the many years, sentimentally rub our fingers over the ones our children made, pull out the stepladder and put our angel to balance precariously on the top branch. We play endless Spotify holiday playlists (here's my favorite) and watch Love, Actually and Elf for the millionth time. And we bring out our beloved holiday books. We giggle over Morris' Disappearing Bag, admire the wit of Auntie Claus, and wipe away the tears as we marvel over The Christmas Miracle Of Jonathan Toomey. Published first in 1995, Susan Wojciechowski's profoundly moving tale is many things. It's a meditation on grief, a testament to learning to live after soul-crushing loss, a paean to power of selfless love, and celebration of the Christ's story. Not only is the prose pitch perfect but the illustrations are Caldecott worthy. (If your family listens to audiobooks, the narration by James Earl Jones is sublime and, oh happy day, free for all to hear.) The book introduces us to Jonathan Toomey, a woodcarver in a small town in colonial America. He keeps to himself and the townspeople, who call him Mr. Gloomy, see him as a curmudgeon who complains when the birds sing and the children play. The village people didn’t know it, but there was a reason for his gloom, a reason for his grumbling, a reason why he walked hunched over, as if carrying a great weight on his shoulders. Some years earlier, when Jonathan Toomey was young and full of life and full of love, his wife and baby had become very ill. And, because those were the days before hospitals and medicines and skilled doctors, his wife and baby had died, three days apart from each other. So Jonathan Toomey had packed his belongings into a wagon and travelled till his tears stop... [truncated]"

            "text": "The Plight Before Christmas needs an editor, has leads in their late thirties who behave at least ten years younger, and manufactures so much angst in its final few chapters that I felt cheated the book didn't come with its own tissues.  Our leads, Whitney and Eli, were in love seventeen years ago and-shocker-it ended badly. Now, Whitney, who lately has been having a shit life, comes home for the holidays to her family's giant cabin in the North Carolina mountains. Her large family is also there too.... including Eli who now was invited by brother, Brendan. (He didn't know their history.) All of the family is portrayed with great detail here-I really enjoyed toddler Peyton-and there's a lot going on in all the varied relationships.  It's clear from the beginning that Eli has come to make amends and win back the woman he loved and then dumped his last year of college. This didn't really do much for me. He's forty and the two dated for eight months back in the day. He's also rich, handsome, funny, great in bed, and wonderful with kids-I had a hard time believing he'd never have found another love. And it seems like the only reason Whitney, despite coming from the world's most perfect family (her two siblings are married with kids), never settled down was because she never got over Eli. That's a lot of wasted time: they should have moved on years ago!  And while I loved Whitney's family-both of her siblings are facing some marital challenges-they did distract from the love story. But really, I'm not sure that's a bad thing. Whitney and Eli spend what seems like eons remembering their pasts, regretting the pasts, thinking about the impact the past has had on them-a hundred pages in, I was wildly bored with their interior monologues. This is a story that needed half as many pages as it has.  I... [truncated]"

            "text": "Hunk for the Holidays knows exactly what it is: a light Christmas love story that exists just to entertain. Lane leans into the charm of a slightly ridiculous premise and, woo hoo, makes it work. The book is warm, funny, and unembarrassed about its own cheer, which is all a holiday romance needs to be. I confess, I often enjoy the “I fell for my male escort” trope. Done well, the setup allows for unexpected connection and, usually, hot sex. Lane delivers on both fronts—Hunk for the Holidays is sexy, funny, and an enjoyable way to spend a winter's afternoon. Our heroine, Cassie McPherson, worn down by her family’s matchmaking, has hired escorts before—just someone to stand beside her at yet another McPherson gathering. So when James Sutton appears in her office, she naturally assumes the agency has sent her a holiday upgrade. James, who arrived expecting a business meeting with her father, steps into the role with deceptive ease. Why not try it? He’s her family’s chief business competitor and the proximity might give him an edge. Besides, the moment they see each other, the sparks are undeniable. I liked Cassie and James. She wants more than the narrow path her father imagines for her, though she hasn’t yet figured out how to seize it. James is an alpha who’s used to being in charge, but Cassie refuses to play along, and he finds that both maddening and appealing. It’s clear they suit each other and it's good fun to watch them slowly figure that out.  Lane surrounds them with an amusing supporting cast. Cassie’s boisterous brothers argue as if it were a competitive sport, her aunt meddles with abandon, and the neighbors behave as though the McPhersons’ business were their own. There’s even a sweet secondary romance for her brother Rory. (I’m a sucker for a good secondary romance, and this one is a winner.) The premise requires some suspension of disbelief—surely someone in this family has looked up their chief competitor—but ... [truncated]"

If you're looking for a flawless, gorgeous, brilliant hero who keeps laying his heart on the line for a woman who has trust issues, you'll love Duet. It's a rainy Thursday night in Portland and Callie, playing a jazz gig in a tiny club, spots a guy at the bar listening with his back to the band. She decides he’s rude and, when she's finished the show, decides to call him out. But, shocker, he turns out not to be an ass and, whoa, is he sexy. Within the hour, she's taken him home and he's given her the best sex of her 35-year-old life. In the morning, he leaves his number, because he instantly is IN TO HER. But then Callie consults Google and discovers Denver is the lead singer of a massively famous rock band, the Road Kings. And because musician, in her personal lexicon, means a man to be avoided at all costs, she panics instead of swoons. Denver, though, is respectfully undeterred. He's 37, been retired for the past five years, and suddenly all he really wants in life is to hang out with and bang Callie. Denver is the rare rock star (who was abandoned as a child) who doesn't do drugs, doesn't much drink, eschews groupies, and is lovely to cats and humans alike. Callie is a loner who clings hard to her small, safe life and, again and again, mistakes fear for wisdom. She is defensive in often hurtful ways that feel unfair given how consistently decent Denver is. And when she learns that the Road Kings have been coaxed to go on tour, well, she just knows very bad things will happen. That's the plot and not one thing about it is surprising. Still, the book, for much of it, is a good time. Kriss’ writing is funny, the band banter is a blas... [truncated]"

            "text": "What if Cinderella—here named Beatrice—were a self-serving, conniving brat? And what if her stepsister—here named Theodosia—were the one who deserved a happy ending? If that sounds like your jam, this fun (if slight) tale is for you. Our story begins where fairy tales usually end—after the wedding. Beatrice is living in a gorgeous castle, ruling the land, and her prince husband adores her. Her life is—seemingly—flawless. Back at the family home, her younger stepsister, Theodosia, has been left behind with a bad temper and an even worse reputation. Her other sister is a bitchy nitwit and her mother an even worse parent than Lady Tremaine. Theo muddles along, nursing her grudge against Bea and hoping that something grand might happen to her when, much to Theo's horror, her mother promises her to a nasty, ancient, controlling Duke. None of Theo’s schemes to escape the marriage work, so on a desperate whim—using instructions she finds in Bea’s old room—she summons her very own fairy godmother. As anyone who’s ever read about fairies knows, the folk give nothing for free. So when Cecily—the gorgeous, witty, and clever fairy who appears—offers to help Theo avoid her impending doom wedding, she demands payment: Theo must complete three tasks of Cecily’s choosing, each designed to make Theo a kinder, better person. Theo, however, is pretty awful. She’s defensive, cutting, and quick to judge and so self-involved and self-loathing that she lashes out at anyone who tries to get close. She spends far too much of the book attacking whoever happens to be nearby—and since she’s both brilliant and mean, her tirades are savage. One scene involving a child is especially hard to take, and even late in the story I still found her too nasty for my tastes. The bargain Theo makes is binding: if she fails to complete the tasks, her life is forfeit. Cecily does provide assistance, though—two familiars, the surly, gorgeous Kaz and the snarky, gorgeous (and gay)... [truncated]"

            "text": "Hatch Kershaw, NFL hockey star (of the fictional Chicago Rebels) and son of one of the sport’s greats, doesn’t want to be at the wedding of his asshat teammate Dash and Summer, his violet eyed bride. (Dash is a trust fund bro who cheats on his fiancée and bullies his teammates.) Summer, Hatch assumes, is a gold digger marrying for the big house and bigger bucks. Watching them tie the knot is the last thing he wants to do—until, moments before the ceremony, he literally catches Summer climbing out a church window. So, because this is a romance&nbsp; novel, he puts her in his SUV and drives her up to his family’s home in Saugatuck, Michigan. He has some time off before the season starts... why not?&nbsp; Summer—born Shelby Mae—is from rural Mississippi, though her portrayal will irritate anyone actually from there. Summer has spent years remaking herself into the kind of woman a millionaire hockey player might marry. Dash made her quit her job with the Rebels—JERK!—and it's clear his incredibly nasty mom will be the one now running Summer's life. So yeah, she was, technically, a gold digger, until she realized what marrying for money really meant. Now, hiding on Michigan’s Gold Coast in Hatch’s grandmother’s hand-me-downs, eating actual food again (skinny-bride syndrome strikes again), and chatting with hottie Hatch about hockey, she’s determined to start over and make a life for herself on her own terms. That, of course, means Hatch, and a relationship, are taboo.&nbsp; For a romance to work, the central barrier has to make sense. Here, it's a stretch. The teammate taboo Hatch says he should respect feels flimsy, and the idea that he—who’s been pining for Summer since he was twenty-one (!!)—would spend five years avoiding her rather than saying something strains belief.&nbsp; Especially because Hatch is flawless: handsome, kind, patient, skilled in every way too many modern romance heroes seem contractually obliged...

            "text": "The Everlasting begins where it ends: beneath a yew tree. Its first chapter, The First Death of Una Everlasting, reads like a eulogy written for a nation's best. We’re told that Una, knight of the realm, died for her queen, and that sacrifice birthed a great nation. But the story we’re given isn’t the one that was. It’s one version, one fate. But in Harrow's brilliant book, fate can be rewritten. Owen works as a historian in the republic of Dominion. Una’s legend is its founding myth, and Owen’s job is to preserve it. When he receives an anonymous envelope containing what appears to be the original manuscript of Una’s story, he doesn’t just read it—he enters it. He finds himself in the past, with Una still alive and her final history unwritten. Now his task is to make her the hero his country's myth demands.&nbsp; The novel’s looping structure—built on repetition and return—is a tricky one and Harrow never once falters in its exectution. Owen evolves slowly and believably. At first, he trusts the fables he's been told, and is sure of the necessity of shared history. But slowly he begins to question who and what Una's legend serves. Una, too, transforms and together they take control-or at least try-of her (and now his) story. Working to maintain the original myth is the nation's queen. She is-and this makes her far more compelling than most iron-fisted rulers-defined not by cruelty, but by conviction. Like many a zealot, she is sure the stories she spins are the ones others should believe. I found her equal parts compelling and terrifying. Had this just been a story about national mythmaking, it would have been a stellar read. But at its heart, it’s a love story. Owen and Una are bound not by destiny but by choice, again and again. And that choice is HARD. It often costs them. It requires loss, surrender, and courage. A great love usually does.&nbsp; How does Una’s story end? That w... [truncated]"

            "text": "I met my husband, a surgeon, in the last year of his final residency, and for the next fifteen years watched him train residents of his own. I have never, until Love Sick, read a romance that captures that world with such accuracy. As anyone who’s gone through it—or lived with someone who has—knows, residency isn’t just hard; it’s a ritual of endurance, a brutal process that shapes doctors to withstand the worst and still show up. You have to be almost superhuman, able to heal on a dime, and composed under pressure that would flatten most of us. It's a world of bullying attendings, harassing administrators, irritated hospitalists, and constant crises. (For better and worse, the system mostly works.) Duncan writes it exactly as it is. This, peeps, is contemporary romance world-building at its very best. Dr. Grace Rose, newly minted (and brilliant) OB-GYN resident, walks into this pressure cooker and discovers, to her horror, she's already been Prynned. Before she’s even unpacked, a rumor spreads that she slept her way into the program. This story is invisible and everywhere. What begins as one malicious lie (its origin, revealed near the end, is both dismaying and believable) metastasizes into legend: Grace is a seductress, an opportunist, and, endlessly, a slut. Depressingly, this gossip isn’t confined to those in her program. The medical center's nurses, techs, and staff pick gleefully at her reputation like it’s communal property. Duncan nails the poisonous complicity of a culture that claims to hate misogyny while feeding on it. Love Sick isn’t just about sexism in medicine; it’s about our endless appetite for tearing down successful, competent women. The professional damage is tremendous and the personal cost—to Grace’s sense of self, to her ability to trust anyone—is devastating. Against that backdrop, Julian Santini—one of her co-residents and, at first, one of the “BrOB-GYNs”—could have been just another dick in scru... [truncated]"

Instead, the first book, Book of Night, was a slog. The magic system barely held together. The pacing dragged. The protagonist, Charlie, drifted through the plot like a placeholder. I did like Vince—her lover. I kept reading because of him, and when Book of Night ended, I knew I'd read book two because I had to know what happened to Vince. I'm glad I did. Thief of Night is everything Book of Night failed to be: smart, funny, and firmly rooted in a world that finally feels real. The story starts strong and keeps its momentum. I enjoyed it immensely. After the events of Book of Night, Charlie is in as much trouble as ever. She’s working for the Cabals, magicians who bend shadows and people to their will. Her sister Posey is hiding something big and probably lethal. At The Rapture, the bar where she works, the upstairs is tense and the downstairs is worse. And Red—who was once Vince—is back. He looks the same, but his memory is gone. He doesn’t remember Charlie or trust her, which is rough because Charlie remembers everything—and misses it. Even though Red doesn't want to be near her, he can't stay away. Staying alive is easier with Red at her side. The two must work together—not only to survive but to stop the people who’ve taken control of the shadow world. I loved them both in this novel, both as individuals and as a pair.&nbsp; Everything in this book works better. The magic finally has rules that make sense. The villains are smart and dangerous because they know what they want. Posey becomes a character in her own right, not just a source of mystery. The shadow world stops being atmosphere and becomes a place you can actually believe in. ... [truncated]"

            "text": "I love many of Denise Mina’s books, but The Good Liar is not one. It begins well. Doctor Claudia O’Sheil, famous forensic scientist, is preparing to speak at a glittering fundraiser. In her folder are two speeches—one that preserves the official story of a murder that occurred one year ago, one that reveals her doubts. Claudia insists she will tell the truth, though doing so will destroy not only her hard-won life but also those around her.&nbsp; Next the story goes back in time to a year earlier where a Lord and his lady were brutally murdered. Claudia's famous blood spatter technique became pivotal to the case-something she, in the present, says is a problem. Over the course of the next 250 pages-this is a short book-we travel with Claudia back and forth in time while Mina stitches together not only what happened but why. What follows is not, however, a mystery in the usual sense. Yes, there is a murder and a trial, and the case itself is neatly constructed. But this is more an ethical puzzle set against the exceedingly awful behavior of London’s wealthy and powerful. This rather nasty world is one that Claudia has worked hard to become a part of and she cherishes her new life of privilege. Losing it-by telling the truth-terrifies her. Will she? Won't she? The answer is clear from the book's earliest pages. Little about this book worked for me. The world Mina's built here is supposed to be complex, full of science and fraud and past crimes and many miserable people doing deeply wrong things. However, in The Good Liar, the supporting cast are superficially rendered and the motivations behind most of the characters' actions are unconvincing. Even the villains seem less like people and more like lazy stand-ins for a despised aristocracy. Despite all the book's tragedies, it moved me not a whit and though the ending may satisfy some, I found it predictable and depressing.&nbsp; ... [truncated]"

            "text": "Longtime readers at AAR will be thrilled to hear that romantic suspense great Jill Sorenson has not only a new book out, but that it’s the start of a series. Cowboy’s Last Stand, the first in her His to Protect series, reminds us why Sorenson has always stood out: she grounds her stories in the struggles of ordinary people and shows how love can take root in difficult circumstances.&nbsp; Natalie Luna has been holding her family together since her husband’s death in Afghanistan. She waits tables, tends bar, raises her five-year-old son, and gets on with her life without drama or complaint. Jason Reed, on leave from the Army, arrives in town. He served with Natalie’s husband and has a story to tell Natalie. Jason has a traumatic brain injury as well as PTSD. &nbsp;From the moment he encounters her, Jason feels pulled toward Natalie, and while the initial spark is immediate, Sorenson lets the relationship develop gradually. Sorenson’s skill in illuminating the lives of everyday people shines here; Natalie and Jason are not larger-than-life heroes but recognizable figures whose choices feel authentic. The suspense subplot—centered on a local murder and Jason’s status as an outsider—adds tension but doesn’t overshadow the romance. The small-town dynamics are believable: the locals are protective of their own, everyone believes they know the truth about everyone else, and gossip fuels mistrust. The town, Last Stand, Texa, is an interesting place. Readers will likely guess Jason’s secret long before Natalie does, but predictability doesn’t diminish the novel’s impact. What matters is the slow, careful way the two leads come to understand each other. Jason is protective without being overbearing; Natalie is resilient without being idealized. Together, they are just lovely. Cowboy's Last Stand is a satisfying start to the series, a romance that balances its love story and its suspense very well. I can't wait to see what Sorenson does nex... [truncated]"

            "text": "Karin Slaughter’s We Are All Guilty Here opens with a disappearance. Two teenage girls vanish during a Fourth of July celebration in North Falls, Georgia—a town that prides itself on familiarity and tradition. Officer Emmy Clifton is devastated. One of the girls is the stepdaughter of her closest friend, and Emmy is determined to find them before it’s too late. Emmy is early in her career, working alongside her beloved father, the town’s sheriff. She is also a mother, a sister, a wife in a marriage that is quietly unraveling, and a member of the Clifton family—a long-established clan whose roots in North Falls run deep. Her marriage may be faltering, but her life is full of responsibility and connection. She is shaped by loyalty, instinct, and a steady commitment to doing what’s right. She is not hardened or brittle. She is present, capable, and fully embedded in the world around her. I liked her tremendously. Slaughter has long excelled at writing strong willed women who, no matter what is thrown their way, survive, even thrive. Emmy is one of her best. In her work life, she's committed to using the power of the law to help others. In her personal life, she's a gift to those she loves. Slaughter makes her relatable and real-in fact, all of the characters are vividly limned. Her parents, George and Myrna, age over the course of the novel in ways that will be immediately recognizable to anyone watching loved ones grow older. Her son Cole, in his twenties, is a standout. He's such a 20 something and yet, like his mom, is observant, decent, and emotionally steady in a way that matters. Emmy’s friendship with Hannah, her closest confidante, and her relationship with her sister-in-law Celia are equally vivid. These women comfort, challenge, and support each other with a mix of candor and care that feels earned. The Cliftons, as a family, struggle to talk openly about their emotions. They are strong, often quiet, unfailingl... [truncated]"
